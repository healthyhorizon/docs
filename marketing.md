### Narrative Frameworks for Key Content Types

**Example Application (Red Light Therapy):**
"In our fast-paced world, cellular recovery often takes a backseat to productivity. [PROBLEM]

Red light therapy works by delivering specific wavelengths that penetrate your skin and energize mitochondria—your cells' power generators. [SCIENCE]

As you relax in the gentle crimson glow, you'll feel a pleasant warmth enveloping your body. Many members describe a sense of deep relaxation combined with subtle energy renewal. [EXPERIENCE]

Beyond the immediate comfort, red light therapy supports skin regeneration, reduces inflammation, and enhances cellular energy production—benefits that continue long after your session ends. [BENEFITS]

Experience the glow for yourself—book a session or try it as part of our 'Vibe. Sweat. Breathe. Glow.' package. [INVITATION]"
